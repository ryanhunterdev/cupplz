## Cupplz

We kept messing up the filter coffee at work so like any good dev I decided to throw an incredibly unnecessarry app that does basic maths at the problem. 
Was a good excuse to try out this PWA stuff I've heard mentioned round the place.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
